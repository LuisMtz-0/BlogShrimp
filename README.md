# BlogShrimp

## Description

- BlogShrimp is a blog post website created for individuals to share any important comment that might have happened to them. It keeps track of the individuals name who created the comment as well as create a formatted date for the day created. 
- This blog post site is my first deployable website with a database that stores the users individual data with the account they cerated or logged in. 
- The hardest challenge I experienced while doing this website was having the correct naming and syntax for each model that was being reference(Had many errors of undefined)
